A real time face recognition system developed in Python using Pillow, OpenCV and NumPy

The steps to run this project are as follows:

Create two empty folders named 'dataset' and 'trainer' in your main folder after unzipping.
Run 1st file "face dataset.py" and enter id 1.
Again run "face dataset.py" with user id 2 with another face.
Run file "2. face training.py" and then further run file "3. face recognition.py".
Tadaa!! The face recognition works.
For more than 2 faces to be recognized change the id number from 2 to any other greater number desired in file "3. face recognition.py".

Thanks!!
